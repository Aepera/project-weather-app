# Weather App

This is a project to build a weather app that shows today's weather and temperature and a 5-day forcast using a weather API.

## The problem

We started with deciding on what we wanted to fetch from the API and then writing JavaScript code to collect the information. The tricky part was to figure out exactly how to write to fetch the right information. We noticed that after we had done the filter to get the 12.00 weather for 5 days, we couldn't use the same line of codes to fetch the same information that we got on today's weather. We then styled the site to be responsive and used css and flexbox to place our elements. This was also the first time that we have tried to mimic an existing design which was a new and interessting experience.

If we had more time we would have added temperature for night time. Maybe a background animation. Added a search so it would be possible to search for different cities.
